# IBD_remission_study
ML_classification.ipynb contains a python script that was used to generate a neural network model to predict IBD <br>
remission status based on patient's microbiome taxonomy (16S rRNA) profiles.
Prior to the neural net training, the data was filtered based on their point-biserial correlation score (|cor| >0.1) and p-value (p-val <0.05)
